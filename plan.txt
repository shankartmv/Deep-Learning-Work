Assumptions
-----------

1. Hand written docs will be in white paper and some dark ink
2. The paper might have horizontal lines but not vertical lines.if so how to remove them ? math paper to be used
3. Each sentence can be written in any manner - meaning not horizontal but also zig zag
4. Dark paper with light ink - to be inverted. very rare case. not to be focussed for now

Flow Chart
----------

1. read the input image
2. find out the average , median size of the line thickness i.e., each character thickness. histogram if possible
3. dilation based on the thickness. 
   Remember - With some white image in a black/dark background. White - img data, black - no data. just like a black image would mean nothing to humans.  
   Dilation - increases white pixels. Thickens the image
   Erosion - decreases white pixels. erodes the pixels. 
4. canny edges with and without blurring
5. remove of horizontal continuous lines
6. find contours and draw contours
7. segmentation
